For many years, people have tried to predict future earnings in the stock market. The stock market has been
considered unpredictable and due to its efficient nature, argued that future performance cannot be predicted
based on past performance. This research used various machine learning techniques to predict future prices of
the S&P500 within a certain level of error. The four methods used were TensorFlow, Multi-Layer Perceptrons,
Support Machine Vector and Long-Term Short Memory. Overall, all techniques used show to be not exactly
accurate in being able to predict future stock prices. Long-term Short Memory was the most accurate but like
all the techniques, not all information is considered within the calculation. Outliers such as socioeconomic
events that can have a significant impact on the market, were not available to the algorithm. Although some
trends can be induced by using machine learning algorithms, it is to our conclusion these machine learning
techniques are not suitable for stock price prediction and that other methods should be explored, such as
Bayesian Networks, that can include other outliers in the decision.

# Conclusion:
  Using the same data set, we tried to use four different machine learning techniques to predict the future prices
  of the S&P500. We used TensorFlow, multi-layer perceptron (MLP), support machine regression (SVR), and
  long-short-term memory recurrent neural network (LTSM), each with varying degrees of success. While some
  techniques were able to predict trends, specific prices were not able to be predicted based on past historical
  data alone. Outliers such socioeconomic events that can have a significant impact on the market, were not
  available to the algorithm. Although some trends can be induced by using machine learning algorithms, it is
  to our conclusion these machine learning techniques are not suitable for stock price prediction and that other
  methods should be explored, such as Bayesian Networks, that can use statistical analysis of other events to
  help better predict stock prices.
